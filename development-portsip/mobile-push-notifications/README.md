# Mobile Push Notifications

Push notifications do not require a particular application to be opened on a device for the message to be received by the end user, so a smartphone user can see notifications even when their phone is locked, or an app is not running.

## Challenges of Push Notifications <a href="#challenges-of-push-notifications" id="challenges-of-push-notifications"></a>

While push notifications are now instrumental in communicating with an application’s users, there are unique challenges within this ecosystem. Making informed business decisions about what, when, and how frequently to push notifications is critical for relevant and appropriate communication with your customers. For instance, respecting time zones, sleep patterns, and user engagement habits can significantly enhance the usefulness of notifications.

Targeting your push notifications to specific user segments and personalizing messages can help ensure you aren’t overwhelming users with unwanted notifications. The goal of push notifications is to provide value to your end users, ensuring they never miss a call or message, not just to serve marketing purposes.
