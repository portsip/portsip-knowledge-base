# WSI: Pub/Sub

PortSIP PBX offers a Pub/Sub mechanism using WebSocket (PortSIP WSI). This allows users to subscribe to PBX events in any programming language. When subscribed events occur, PortSIP PBX automatically pushes event messages to subscribers in JSON format.

Support version: v16.0 or higher

## Service Port

The PortSIP PBX/UCaaS provides WSI on port **8887** over **WSS**, the server must be allowed this port on the firewall for TCP, which requires WSS(TLS).

## Server URL

The WSI Server URL varies between PortSIP PBX versions:

* **v22.0 or higher**: `wss://pbx.portsip.com:8887/wsi`
* **v16.x**: `wss://pbx.portsip.com:8885`

The WebSocket client application needs to connect to the appropriate URL. Please replace `pbx.portsip.com` it with your actual PBX domain.

## **Topics and Message Type**

PortSIP PBX provides the topics and keys for the Pub/Sub below.

### queue\_management\_events

The tenant Admin and Queue Manager have permission to subscribe to the `queue_management_events`. Once successfully subscribed, the PBX will push all current queue information to the subscriber. After that, during the subscription, whenever a queue is updated, deleted, or added, the subscriber will receive the queue information in real-time.

Below are the message keys.

* **queue\_status**: If a subscriber successfully subscribed to queue events, the PBX will push the queueâ€™s current status to the subscriber for all waiting for callers and agents.

## **Authentication**

Once connected to the WSI server, use the following JSON message to authenticate:

### **PBX System Administrator Authentication**

```json
{
"command":"auth",
"username":"admin",
"password":"A1s2d3f4",
}
```

The system administrator can currently subscribe only to extension management events. To subscribe to other events, a Tenant Admin or Queue Manager is required.

### Tenant User Authentication

Tenant administrators, users(extensions) can authenticate using either username/password or extension number/extension password.

#### Authenticate with Username

```json
{
"command":"auth",
"username":"testuser1",
"password":"A1s2d3f4",
"domain" : "test.io"
}
```

The **`domain`** is the SIP domain of the extension, the **`password`** is the **`user password`** of extension.

#### Authenticate with Extension Number

You can authenticate using the SIP extension number and its corresponding password as well.

```json
{
"command":"auth",
"extension_number":"101",
"password":"A1s2d3f4",
"domain" : "test.io"
}
```

If there is no error, the response is as follows:

```json
{
  "command": "auth",
  "id": "1",
  "status": 0
}
```

Otherwise, the response includes errors as below:

```json
{
  "command": "auth",
  "error": "access_token , username , domain or password error",
  "id": "2",
  "status": -1
}
```

## **Subscribe and Unsubscribe**

After successful authentication, the user can subscribe to events.

### Subscribe to CDR Event

To subscribe to **Call Detail Record (CDR)** events, send the following command. Once subscribed, all CDRs for the tenant the subscriber belongs to will be pushed to the subscriber. Only the **Tenant Administrator** has permission to subscribe.

```json
{
   "command":"subscribe",
   "topics":[
      "cdr_events"
   ]
}
```

### Subscribe to Global CDR Event

The **System Administrator** can subscribe to the global **CDR** event to receive CDR events from multiple tenants. To subscribe to the global CDR event for specific tenants, send the following command:

```sh
{
   "command":"subscribe",
   "topics":[
      "global_cdr_events"
   ],
  "tenants":[
      "23435",
      "74235345"
   ]
}
```

### Subscribe to Extension Event
