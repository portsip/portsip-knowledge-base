# Calling from Another Device

### Calling from Another Device Using the PortSIP ONE App

The PortSIP ONE desktop app lets you manage contacts and initiate calls while using **another device,** such as your **mobile phone** or **desk phone,** to place and receive the actual call.

For example, if you prefer to make calls on your desk phone, you can route all outgoing calls from the PortSIP ONE app to that device with just a few clicks, allowing you to work in the way that suits you best.
