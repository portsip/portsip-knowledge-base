# Click to Call

## What is Click-to-Call?

Click-to-call is a feature that allows users to initiate phone calls with a single click, leveraging Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology to establish the connection between two parties. This feature is also referred to as "click-to-dial" or "one-click calling."

Originally developed for call centers, the click-to-call functionality aimed to streamline outbound calling, minimize dialing errors, and enhance efficiency. Over time, it has evolved to incorporate technologies like WebRTC and browser plugins, making it even more accessible.

In addition to its use in call centers, click-to-call allows users to initiate phone calls directly from web pages. When a user clicks on a phone number or a "click-to-call" button on a website, the action triggers their phone app (on mobile devices) to dial the number using their existing phone service.
