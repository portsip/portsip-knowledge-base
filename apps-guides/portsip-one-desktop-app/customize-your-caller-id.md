# Customize Your Caller ID

**Caller ID** is an essential feature that allows recipients to see the caller’s information before answering a call. It enhances communication transparency and professionalism within your organization.

## Default caller ID settings

By default, the **PortSIP PBX** system determines the outbound Caller ID based on the PBX configuration. This ensures consistency and accuracy in the information displayed to call recipients.

## Customizing caller ID

While the default settings provide a standardized Caller ID, there are scenarios where you might need to customize it for specific calls or globally across your organization. PortSIP PBX offers flexibility in adjusting Caller ID settings both on a per-call basis and globally.

**Note:** Administrators have the ability to restrict certain Caller ID modifications across the entire office to maintain control and security over outbound call information.

## Set your caller ID

A user’s **outbound Caller ID** can be configured in several places within the **PortSIP PBX** system. The settings are applied based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Extension-Specific Settings:**
   * The **outbound Caller ID** can be set individually for each user under their **Extension** settings. This allows for personalized Caller ID information for specific users.
2. **User Group Settings:**
   * The **outbound Caller ID** can also be configured at the **user group** level. If the user belongs to a specific group, the group’s Caller ID setting will take precedence over individual user settings unless overridden.
3. **Company-Wide Settings:**
   * The **outbound Caller ID** can be defined at the **Company** level, under **Company > Outbound Caller ID**. This setting will apply to all users who do not have specific Caller ID settings at the extension or group level.
