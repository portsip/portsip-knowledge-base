# Change Your Call Queue Status

When your administrator assigns you as an agent to a call queue, you can manage your call queue status directly within the **PortSIP ONE** app.&#x20;

When a call enters your assigned call queue and your status is set to **Ready**, you will receive a notification within the app. You can then answer the call directly from the PortSIP ONE app.

## Changing Your Call Queue Status

To manage your call queue status, follow these simple steps:

1. **Locate the Queues Status Icon**\
   In the appâ€™s **title bar**, you will see the **Queues Status Icon**. This icon displays your current status and lists all the call queues you are a part of.
2. **Open the Status Menu**\
   Click on the **Queues Status Icon**. A menu window will appear, showing your current status and providing available options to change it.
3. **Select a New Status**\
   From the **Agent Status** dropdown, select your desired status. This status will be applied to all queues you are currently logged into (joined).
4. **Log In or Log Out of Individual Queues**\
   In the list of queues, each one has a **Switch ON/OFF Option**. Log in or Log out a queue by toggling it on or off.
