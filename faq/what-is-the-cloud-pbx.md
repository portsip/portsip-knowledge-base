# What is the Cloud PBX?

Cloud PBX (Cloud-based Private Branch Exchange) is a virtual PBX system rooted in the internet, which uses a cloud-based service to control and manage calls to and from a business and delivers advanced calling features and unified communications using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology.

You might also see this referred to as a VoIP system, UCaaS, UC, cloud-hosted PBX, or hosted PBX, basically, they are the same thing.

Traditionally, PBX systems were located on-premises. These machines are big and need their own storage room. They also require significant capital investment, making them out of reach for smaller businesses.

The advent of the cloud has revolutionized this. A Cloud PBX is hosted in secure, remote data centers and delivered via the internet. It offers the same call routing and management features as an on-premises PBX, but without the need for costly hardware. Furthermore, Cloud PBX solutions are available as a service with flexible plans. This allows smaller businesses to subscribe to the service, avoiding the heavy investment associated with an expensive on-premise system.
