# What is the Cloud PBX?

Essentially, cloud PBX combines a traditional PBX (private branch exchange) phone system with VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology into one hosted solution. In other words, your regular old phone system is stored in a data center (or data centers) and is usually secured and managed by your vendor.

You might have heard cloud PBX referred to as hosted PBX, virtual PBX, or simply as a hosted phone system, but they all generally mean the same thing.

Cloud PBX can be accessed via an Internet connection instead of the usual public service telephone network or PSTN. You might know these as “analog lines” (or PRI or something similar). All the setup and maintenance is handled by the provider. This helps you cut down on installation and hardware costs and allows for quick and easy deployment—while effectively freeing you from the clutches of telecom companies and expensive phone systems and handsets

You still get all the functionalities of a traditional phone system. The only difference is you’re now accessing these over the Internet, which also indirectly leads to other perks like easier maintenance, lower costs, and more flexibility and scalability. This makes cloud PBX a practical and cost-effective business communication solution, for startups and small businesses as well as larger enterprises.

Fun fact: It’s often easier for smaller and medium-sized businesses to switch to a cloud PBX phone system because the upfront costs (CAPEX) are so drastically reduced. Instead, the cost is spread out over time—years in fact—as recurring user licenses.
