# What's Cloud PBX?

Cloud PBX (Cloud-based Private Branch Exchange) is a virtual PBX system rooted in the internet, which uses a cloud-based service to control and manage calls to and from a business and delivers advanced calling features and unified communications using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology.&#x20;

Traditionally, PBX systems were located on-premises. These machines are big and need their own storage room. They also require significant capital investment, making them out of reach for smaller businesses.

Today, Cloud-hosted PBX systems are a popular business telephone solution for Unified Communications service providers and MSPs.

The advent of the cloud has revolutionized this. A Cloud PBX is hosted in secure, remote data centers and delivered via the internet. It offers the same call routing and management features as an on-premises PBX but without the need for costly hardware. Furthermore, Cloud PBX solutions are available as a service with flexible plans. This allows smaller businesses to subscribe to the service, avoiding the heavy investment associated with an expensive on-premise system.

## Benefits of Cloud PBX <a href="#s4" id="s4"></a>

There are many reasons why businesses switch from an on-premises PBX to hosting their business phone system in the cloud.

When comparing the two, you’ll notice that cloud PBX offers a wealth of features — that’s because there are dozens of unified communications features to implement.

### 1. Flexibility & remote workers

One of the top reasons to switch to cloud PBX is the flexibility it provides for remote employees.

The VoIP protocol lets employees use an app and immediately have calls forwarded to any number or device, anywhere in the world. All that’s needed is a cloud PBX provider and reliable internet. This accomplishes what an on-premises PBX typically can’t.

### 2. Easy setup & maintenance

Another big plus is the fast setup with minimal maintenance. Cloud PBXs can deploy in days without on-site infrastructure. You don’t need to hire dedicated staff to manage changes or troubleshoot issues.

The cloud-based nature makes the whole system simpler to implement & maintain.

### 3. Better customization & control

With a cloud PBX, call settings and routing can be adjusted instantly. Features like **call forwarding**, meeting lines, caller ID, and voicemail to SMS are easily toggled on/off. The days of calling the phone company for changes are over — cloud platforms put businesses in charge.

### 4. Cost efficiencies&#x20;

The relatively low cost of cloud PBX is often the most attractive feature for businesses. With cloud PBX, you don’t have to pay large upfront expenses to purchase and set up hardware. Instead, you can pay monthly for the number of seats actually needed for the business, which can be substantially cheaper over the long run.

Cloud PBX service providers also take care of maintenance and updates, which saves you the extra expense there, as well as ensuring that all your users are working from exactly the same version of the software. This helps your IT team happy (and the cost savings will keep your Finance team happy).

### 5. Enhanced reliability & redundancy

Arguably the most crucial benefit is reliability.

Since cloud PBX isn’t tied to physical wiring or an on-site box, many infrastructure failure points are avoided. With built-in failover and interconnected data centers, cloud PBX offers redundancy that keeps companies running smoothly.

For businesses, increased reliability is arguably the most crucial benefit.

Even in the event of a critical situation requiring evacuation, you can configure the VoIP phone system for remote employees to alert customers with timely messages, forward calls to voicemail, or even forward calls to cell phones.

### 6. Call security and encryption

The calls transmit call data packets between the cloud PBX and IP phones/PC app/mobile app.

Leading business VoIP providers encrypt these voice packets using Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), making it nearly impossible for data to be intercepted. Encryption secures all call data without impacting voice quality.
