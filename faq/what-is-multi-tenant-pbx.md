# What Is Multi-Tenant PBX?

The multi-tenant architecture uses a single instance of a software application to serve multiple customers. In a multi-tenant environment, tenants share common features like security, business logic, and resource management. However, each tenant is isolated from the others to protect its private data and settings.&#x20;

Multi-tenant architecture can be more cost-effective and easier to deploy globally than other architectures. It also requires minimal IT support.&#x20;

Multi-tenant architecture can also allow for easier integration with other software applications via an application programming interface (API). Multi-tenant cloud environments are also generally quicker to set up than single-tenant environments.&#x20;

In a multi-tenant environment, a cloud vendor can offer their services to many customers at a much lower cost than if each customer required their own dedicated infrastructure.
