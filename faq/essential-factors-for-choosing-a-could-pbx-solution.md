# Essential Factors for Choosing a Could PBX Solution

### What is Cloud PBX (Private Branch Exchange)?

Cloud PBX (Cloud-based Private Branch Exchange) is a virtual PBX system rooted in the internet, which uses a cloud-based service to control and manage calls to and from a business and delivers advanced calling features and unified communications using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. Traditionally, PBX systems were located on-premises. These machines are big and need their own storage room. They also require significant capital investment, making them out of reach for smaller businesses.

The advent of the cloud has revolutionized this. A Cloud PBX is hosted in secure, remote data centers and delivered via the internet. It offers the same call routing and management features as an on-premises PBX, but without the need for costly hardware. Furthermore, Cloud PBX solutions are available as a service with flexible plans. This allows smaller businesses to subscribe to the service, avoiding the heavy investment associated with an expensive on-premise system.

### Essential Factors for Choosing a Could PBX Solution

Today, every VoIP Service provider is looking for a good solution to host their Cloud PBX service. However, several crucial elements need to be considered when making this decision:

* **Multi-tenant.** A multi-tenant architecture is essential for a Cloud PBX, given its need to serve many businesses. In this setup, each business acts as a separate tenant within the Cloud PBX. These tenants are isolated from one another, each perceiving that they have their own dedicated PBX in the cloud. It’s hard to imagine a Cloud PBX solution that doesn’t support multi-tenancy. Without it, service providers would need to set up a separate PBX instance for each tenant. This approach would not only be challenging to manage and maintain but would also consume massive server resources. Therefore, multi-tenancy is a critical feature for any Cloud PBX solution.
* **High performance.**  High performance is a fundamental requirement for any Cloud PBX solution, since a Cloud PBX could be serving thousands of businesses (tenants) at any given time, and managing a high volume of calls is part of its daily operations. The performance of the service is vital to ensure a smooth call experience. The Cloud PBX must efficiently handle a variety of calls, including regular calls, group calls, queue calls, and meeting calls. The poor performance could lead to customer attrition.
* **Rich features.** The Cloud PBX offers not only the same features as an on-premise PBX, but also a suite of modern unified communication tools for businesses. These tools encompass audio, video, messaging, and presence, as well as sharing and collaboration capabilities. Additionally, Cloud PBX integrates with WebRTC and Microsoft Teams, and includes Session Border Controller (SBC) offerings.
* **Open and Integratable Platform**: The PBX should be an open platform that provides a full REST API, allowing service providers to build their own web portal page. It should also provide a webhook and PUB/SUB mechanism for seamless integration with customer's current business system. The solution should also include a client app SDK that enables service providers to build their own applications with ease.
* **All-In-One solution.**  Service providers are in search of an All-In-One solution that is ready to use out of the box. The Cloud PBX solution should include ready-to-use client apps for iOS, Android, Windows, and WebRTC, and offer rebranding with customer brands. This allows service providers to deliver a unified branding experience, all at no extra cost.
