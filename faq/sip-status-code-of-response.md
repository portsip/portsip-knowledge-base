# SIP Status Code of Response

When you troubleshoot PortSIP PBX issues, the specific cause of a call/request failure can be identified through a combination of the following response codes:

SIP response code (Status code): A three-digit response code that shows the request status. This code is received from the PortSIP PBX. It explains what occurred. For example, the PBX didn't reply in a timely manner. The SIP response codes are defined in [RFC 3261](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3261#page-182).
