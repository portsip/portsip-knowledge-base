# Purchase a DID on the Twilio

Before placing or receiving a call, you need to have an active DID or a dozen DID numbers on your Twilio account. If you already have DID numbers on your Twilio account, the below steps are optional.

To purchase a DID on your Twilio account:

1. Log in to your [Twilio console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Follow the article [How to Search for and Buy a Twilio Phone Number from Console to buy the DID numbers](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223135247).
3. Purchased numbers can be found in the [Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/search) under **Develop > Phone Numbers > Manage > Active Numbers**.
