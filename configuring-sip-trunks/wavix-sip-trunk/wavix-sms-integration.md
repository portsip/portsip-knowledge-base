# Wavix SMS Integration

Before proceeding with the next steps, you need to [purchase a DID on the Wavix platform](purchase-a-did-on-wavix-platform.md).

## Register a Sender ID

Before sending an SMS or MMS message, you need to activate a Sender ID on the Wavix platform. A Sender ID is the message sender details recipients will see on their devices. Sender IDs can be either numeric or alphanumeric presenting your brand or service name.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must use Numeric Sender IDs, if you want to enable 2-way messaging service. For one-way SMS you can use both Numeric and AlphanumericSender IDs.
{% endhint %}

Assume you have purchased DID phone numbers as per the guide on[Purchase a DID on the Wavix platform](purchase-a-did-on-wavix-platform.md).

The following step [SMS-enable your number](wavix-sms-integration.md#sms-enable-your-number) is mandatory only if you have purchased U.S. or Canadian numbers to send messages using a U.S. or Canadian phone number as the Sender ID.

If you have purchased other countries' phone numbers and wish to use them as the Sender ID, please skip  [SMS-enable your number](wavix-sms-integration.md#sms-enable-your-number) and scroll down to the Create a Sender ID on the Wavix Platform section.

### SMS-enable your number

Inbound SMS can be enabled on US and Canadian phone numbers only. To activate support of inbound SMS and MMS:

1. Select **Numbers & trunks** in the top menu and click **My Numbers**
2. Select a number you want to activate inbound SMS on

## Create a Sender ID on the Wavix platform

To create a Sender ID:

1. Select **SMS** in the top menu and click on **Sender IDs**
2. Then click **Add New Sender ID** and select the Sender ID type, i.e. Alphanumeric or Numeric

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/wafix-fig30.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Alphanumeric Sender ID can be up to 11 characters long and can only include upper- and lower-case letters and the digits from 0 through 9, and space. A numeric Sender ID can be associated with an SMS-enabled number in your account only.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have chosen the Numeric Sender ID type, but do not see any of your numbers in the Sender ID drop-down list, make sure the number you are looking for is actually SMS-enabled.
{% endhint %}

3. Select country(-ies) you will be sending SMS to. Depending on the destination countries, additional restrictions for Sender IDs may apply. Hover over the i icon next to the country name to see the details. If the Sender ID Type youâ€™ve selected is not supported for the destination, the country will be greyed out.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alphanumeric Sender IDs are not supported in a variety of countries, including the US and Canada, and may require pre-registration by local carriers in some others.
{% endhint %}

4. Review your Sender ID and the list of destinations. Your Sender ID will be automatically listed in countries that do not require additional paperwork. A member of the Wavix provisioning team will reach out to you with additional information regarding the process of Sender ID registration in countries that do.

5. Click the **Next** button to assign this trunk to the tenants and provide your Wavix DIDs/Numbers to them with the DID Pool (DID numbers).  A DID can be only assigned to one tenant.

A tenant assigned to this trunk can only use the DID numbers within the DID pool range to create inbound and outbound rules and configure the outbound caller ID for extensions.

* DID Pool: The DID pool can consist of a single number, a range of numbers, or a combination of both. For example:
  * `16468097065`
  * `16468097065;16468097066`
  * `16468097065-16468097066;16468097069`&#x20;
  * `16468097065-16468097066;16468097070-16468097080`

Click the **OK** button to save the changes. The trunk configuration is now complete.

In the trunk list, you will see the status displayed as **Registered** (for IP Based Trunk it always displays Registered).
