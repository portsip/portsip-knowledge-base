# Configuring Wavix IP Authentication Trunk

Before proceeding with the next steps, you need to [purchase a DID on the Wavix platform](purchase-a-did-on-wavix-platform.md).

## Create a SIP Trunk on the Wavix platform

To create a new SIP trunk on the Wavix platform:

1. Select **Trunks** under **Numbers & trunks** in the top menu
2. Click the **Create new** button
3. Select **IP Authentication** under the **Authentication method**
4. Enter your PortSIP PBX static IP and click **Submit**
5. Click **Save** to apply changes

Once the Wavix ops team approves your request, IP authentication will be activated on your Wavix SIP trunk.

{% hint style="info" %}
After submitting the IP authentication request, youâ€™ll not be able to update your IP address or change the authentication method.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, an IP address can only be mapped to a single SIP trunk. If you need to have several Wavix SIP trunks sharing the same IP address, please get in touch with support@wavix.com
{% endhint %}

After the SIP trunk is successfully created, it will appear on the list of SIP trunks on your account.

Please be advised that your 5-digit SIP trunk username is generated automatically and displayed in the SIP trunk ID column.
{% endhint %}

## Configure IP Authentication Trunk in PortSIP PBX

The IP Authentication Wavix trunk corresponds to the **IP-Based Trunk** in PortSIP PBX. You must configure the **IP-Based Trunk** at the PortSIP PBX system administrator level. Once successfully configured, you can share this trunk with tenants.

Please follow the below steps:

1. Sign in to the PortSIP PBX Web Portal as a System Administrator. Navigate to the left menu and select **Call Manager > Trunks**.&#x20;
2. Click the **Add** button to open a menu. From the menu, choose **IP-Based Trunk**.

3. Enter the trunk name and choose the brand:
   * **Name**: Enter a friendly name for the trunk.
   * **Brand**: Select one of the Wavix trunks from the Brand field, such as **Wavix - US**.

4. Click the **Next** button to adjust the options for the trunk. We recommend using the default settings, except for the **Max Concurrent Calls** field. This field limits the maximum number of calls that PortSIP can establish with this trunk. You can change it to an appropriate value.

5. Click the **Next** button to assign this trunk to the tenants and provide them with the DID Pool (DID numbers). A tenant assigned to this trunk can only use the DID numbers within the DID pool range to create inbound and outbound rules, and configure the outbound caller ID for extensions.

* DID Pool: The DID pool can consist of a single number, a range of numbers, or a combination of both. For example:
  * `16468097065`
  * `16468097065;16468097066`
  * `16468097065-16468097066`
  * `16468097065-16468097066;16468097069`&#x20;
  * `16468097065-16468097066;16468097070-16468097080`

Click the **OK** button to save the changes. The trunk configuration is now complete.
