# Purchase a DID on Wavix Platform

Before placing or receiving a call, you need to have an active DID or a dozen DID numbers on your Wavix account. If you already have an active number on your Wavix account, the below steps are optional.

To purchase a DID on your Wavix account:

1. Log in to your account on [Wavix platform](https://app.wavix.com/auth/sign)
2. Click on **Buy** under **Numbers & trunks** in the top menu
3. Select a country and region you wish to purchase a DID in
4. Choose a specific number or numbers and click the **Buy Now** button
5. You will be redirected to the Cart where you can confirm your choice and check out the DID(s).

Some DIDs may require proof of local address and other documents before they can be activated. To enable these DIDs to receive inbound calls, upload the documents required, and wait until they are approved by the Wavix Number Provisioning team.
{% endhint %}

After succesfully puchased the DID, you can now follow one of the guides to configure the trunk with PortSIP PBX.
