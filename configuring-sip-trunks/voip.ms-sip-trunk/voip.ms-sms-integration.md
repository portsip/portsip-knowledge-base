# VoIP.ms SMS Integration

Before proceeding with the next steps, you need to[ purchase a DID on the VoIP.ms platform](purchase-a-did-on-voip.ms.md).

The VoIP.ms SMS service has some limitations. Please refer to this link for more details: [Service Limitations](https://wiki.voip.ms/article/SMS-MMS#Service\_Limitations).

## Set an API Password

If you donâ€™t already have an API Password set up, please follow these steps to generate one:

1. Log in to your VoIP.ms client portal.
2. Navigate to **Main Menu > SOAP and REST/JSON API**.
3. If the API is not already enabled, click on **Enable the API**.
4. Enter a password in the **API Password** field, then click **Save API Password**.
5. Make sure to note down the API Password for future reference.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When you set up the API Password, be sure to copy and store it in a secure place, as it won't be visible again after generation. It will only be available to be copied once it is set up. If you lost your API Password, you need to set up a new one.
