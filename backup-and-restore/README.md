Backup and restore refers to technologies and practices for making periodic copies of data and applications to a separate, secondary device and then using those copies to recover the data and applications—and the business operations on which they depend—in the event that the original data and applications are lost or damaged due to a power outage, cyberattack, human error, disaster, or some other unplanned event.
