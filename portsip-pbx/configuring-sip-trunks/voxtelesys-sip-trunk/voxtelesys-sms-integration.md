Thatâ€™s it! The SMS integration between Voxtelesys and PortSIP PBX is now complete.

Here are some additional tips:

* Ensure the DID number (with SMS enabled) is assigned to the user/extension.
* Inbound SMS follows the inbound rules likes inbound calls in PortSIP PBX.
* PortSIP PBX supports SMS in E164 format. Make sure the numbers are configured in PortSIP as E164, and ensure that both your Messaging Application and Inbound Trunk on Voxtelesys are set up in E164 format.

## Verify Configuration

Now you can [create the outbound and inbound rules](configuring-outbound-and-inbound-calls.md) in PortSIP PBX for sending and receiving SMS/MMS using the Voxtelesys Trunk, just like you create the rules for making and receiving calls.
