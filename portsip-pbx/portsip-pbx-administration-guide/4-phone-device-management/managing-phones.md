# Managing Phones

[PortSIP PBX](https://www.portsip.com/portsip-pbx/) provides an easy way to monitor and manage your phones and softphones throughout your network. The **Call Manager > Phones** menu in the [PortSIP PBX](https://www.portsip.com/portsip-pbx/) Web Portal allows you to:

* View all the phones in the network, including IP and MAC.
* View all PortSIP Clients connected in softphone mode.
* Check the firmware version that the phone is running.
* Remotely reboot one or all of the phones.
* Re-provision the phones.
* Launch the admin interface of the phone.
* Monitor the security of the extension password and PIN. Weak extension passwords and PINs are the most common cause of security breaches.

## **Adding Phones**

You can add phones to [PortSIP PBX](https://www.portsip.com/portsip-pbx/) in the following ways:

* [Plug and Play - Plug in the phone in the local LAN](provision-phone-using-pnp.md)
* [By RPS - for remote phones](provision-phone-using-pnp.md)

## **Changing Phone Settings**

Changes made to the phone configuration from the **User**, **Extension**, **and Phone Provisioning** tabs for certain users, you can force the IP Phone to pick up the new configuration immediately by re-provision.&#x20;

If you need to re-provision the phones, for example after you have made configuration changes:

1. Select menu **Call Manager > Phones**.
2. Choose a provisioned phone that you wish to re-provision.
3. Click the **Reprovision** button.
4. If the phone needs a reboot, it will be done automatically.
5. The new configurations will be provisioned automatically.
