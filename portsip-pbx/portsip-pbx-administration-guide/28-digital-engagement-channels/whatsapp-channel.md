# WhatsApp Channel

With over 2 billion monthly users, WhatsApp stands as one of the most popular consumer messaging and communication platforms worldwide. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring your WhatsApp Business account on PortSIP PBX, enabling your extension users to communicate directly with customers via WhatsApp.

## **Prerequisites**

To integrate WhatsApp Business with PortSIP PBX, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. **WhatsApp Business Platform Account**:
   * You must have a WhatsApp Business Platform account set up with an associated phone number.
   * The phone number must not be registered with any other WhatsApp account, whether on a device or virtually.
   * If you wish to use a number already linked to an existing WhatsApp account, you must first delete the account. [Read more here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/605464643328528/?locale=en\_US).
2. **Inbound Messaging Only**:
   * WhatsApp integration with PortSIP PBX supports responding to inbound messages only.
   * A WhatsApp user must initiate the conversation by sending you a message.
   * Once a message is received, you have a 24-hour window to respond.
