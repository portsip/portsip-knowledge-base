# 28 Digital Engagement Channels

In today’s business landscape, digital communication has become essential, providing customers with numerous ways to ask questions, provide feedback, and share their positive experiences. PortSIP Digital Engagement enables seamless connections between you and your clients across multiple channels, ensuring you never miss important interactions.

Let’s explore the capabilities available in each of our supported channels, all of which deliver around-the-clock self-service automation and enable live agent engagement for an exceptional customer experience.

## Supported Channels

PortSIP currently supports the following channels, with plans to expand in the future:

### **SMS**

Business text messaging allows you to send short messages (SMS) from your business phone number directly to your contact’s phone number. Unlike team or instant messaging, which occurs within threads or channels and does not require phone numbers, SMS creates a direct, personal line of communication.

PortSIP PBX integrates with leading [SMS providers ](../../configuring-sip-trunks/)to enhance customer communications through business SMS. This allows you to send impactful SMS campaigns that drive engagement and open a two-way communication channel to respond to customer inquiries seamlessly.

### **WhatsApp**

PortSIP’s WhatsApp integration enables you to automate responses to frequently asked questions, provide answers to common queries, and manage even complex workflows through the customer’s WhatsApp client. For sessions requiring live assistance, you can effortlessly route customers to the appropriate agent using the Dialpad Digital Engagement interface.
