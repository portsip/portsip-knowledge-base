# Speed Dial 100

Speed Dial 100 allows you to assign the numbers you call most. Once programmed you just dial two digits(00-99). You can program this two ways: via the personal web portal or dialing the FAC from IP Phone/Softphone. The web portal is a bit easier to manage and confirm accuracy, but either way can work.

Assume we need to program the speed dial code **06** for the phone number **0015620671**.

## **Program Option 1**

1. Log into PortSIP PBX Web portal.
2. Edit the user profile.
3. Click the **Speed Dial 100** tab and click the Add button.
4. Select the **06** from the code list, and enter the phone number **0015620671** and the description in the corresponding boxes.
5. Click **OK** to save the settings.

## **Program Option 2**

1. From the phone dial **\*75060015620671**.
2. The PBX will play the voice prompts to tell you whether the operation is a success or not.

To use it from the phone, simply dial two digits in case is **06**, and the PBX will call the number **0015620671**.

## Modify the Speed Dial Code Settings

Dialing **\*75060033125** from your phone will overwrite the previous speed dial settings for code **06** and set the new settings to **0033125**.

## Delete the Speed Dial Code

Dialing **\*7506\*** will delete the speed dial code **06** settings.
