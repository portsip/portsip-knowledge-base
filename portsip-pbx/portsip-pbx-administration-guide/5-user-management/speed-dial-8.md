# Speed Dial 8

Speed Dial 8 allows you to set up to eight frequently dialed or hard-to remember long strings of digits that can be called with the push of a button. Users can then use the single digit instead of full numbers to place calls.

This single-digit code(2-9) is referred to as a speed code. The user can associate a phone number including 911 emergency and 611 for customer service.&#x20;

There are two methods by which a user can program speed codes, through the Personal web portal or by dialing a feature access code.

Assume we need to program the speed dial code **5** for the phone number **12345678**.

## **Program Option 1**

1. Log into PortSIP PBX Web portal.
2. Edit the user profile.
3. Click the **Speed Dial 8** tab and click the **Add** button.
4. Select the **5** from the code list, and enter the phone number **12345678** and the description in the corresponding boxes.
5. Click **OK** to save the settings.

## **Program Option 2**

1. From the phone dial **\*74512345678**.
2. The PBX will play the voice prompts to tell you whether the operation is a success or not.

To use it from the phone, simply dial a single digit in case is **5**, and the PBX will call the number **1234568**.

## Modify the Speed Dial Code Settings

Dialing **\*7450033125** from your phone will overwrite the previous speed dial settings for code **5** and set the new settings to **0033125**.

## Delete the Speed Dial Code

Dialing **\*745\*** will delete the speed dial code **5** settings.
