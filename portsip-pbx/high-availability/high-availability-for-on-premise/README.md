# High Availability for On-Premise

A modern unified communications system is much more complicated than the phone system of a lot of years ago — most likely, it’s now running on commodity PC, Server, and private cloud platform infrastructure rather than a custom-built hardware chassis.  It’s now connected to the Internet, and probably sends calls across the network as well, instead of having dedicated analog or digital lines for each extension and for each connection to the outside world.

When installing a modern unified communications system, the topic of resiliency is often of high importance.  Customers expect their unified communications system to be resilient, despite the ever-increasing complexity.&#x20;

With PortSIP PBX solutions, PortSIP is glad to give the HA function, which allows it to take over in the event that the server fails.
