# PBX Cluster (v22.x)

{% hint style="info" %}
This topic is only applicable to the PortSIP PBX v22.x and later versions.
{% endhint %}

This guide explains how to configure cluster servers for a standalone PortSIP PBX deployment, designed to support over 1 million users, approximately 50,000 online (registered/signed-in) users, and up to 10,000 simultaneous calls. The setup is also well-suited for high-demand scenarios, including large meetings, IVR, and call queues.

If you've already deployed your PBX in High Availability (HA) mode and wish to expand to a cluster configuration, please refer to the guide in [**High Availability (v22.x)**](../high-availability-v22.x/).
