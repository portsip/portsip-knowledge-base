# PBX Cluster (v22.x)

{% hint style="info" %}
This topic is only applicable to the PortSIP PBX v22.x and later versions.
{% endhint %}

This guide explains how to deploy the standalone PortSIP PBX with cluster support, capable of handling over 1 million users, approximately 50,000 online (registered/signed-in) users, and up to 10,000 simultaneous calls. This setup also supports heavy meetings, IVR, and call queue scenarios.

If you've already deployed your PBX in High Availability (HA) mode and wish to expand to a cluster configuration, please refer to the guide in [**High Availability (v22.x)**](../high-availability-v22.x/).
