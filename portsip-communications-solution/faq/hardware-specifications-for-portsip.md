## IM Service

For optimal performance and scalability, the installation of the **IM service** can be configured depending on the number of users and the intensity of their use of the Instant Messaging (IM) feature.

* **For Fewer Than 1,000 Users:**\
  If your user base is under 1,000, you can install the **IM service** and the **PBX service** on the **same server**.
* **For More Than 1,000 Users or Heavy IM Usage:**\
  If you have a larger user base or if the IM feature is heavily used, it is recommended to install the **IM service on a separate server** to ensure better performance and scalability.
