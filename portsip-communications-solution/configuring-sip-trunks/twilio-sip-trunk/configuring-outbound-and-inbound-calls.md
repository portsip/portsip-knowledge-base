When configuring your Outbound Rules make sure that all numbers are dialed either in the 10-digit (e.g. `3322496213`), 11-digit format (e.g. `13322496213`) or E164 format (e.g. `+13322496213`).

Depending on your usersâ€™ dialing habits, you may want to strip some of the leading digits or prepend the country code. For example, the below configuration can be used to prepend all dialed numbers with the leading 1 in case your users are accustomed to US domestic number in the national format.
