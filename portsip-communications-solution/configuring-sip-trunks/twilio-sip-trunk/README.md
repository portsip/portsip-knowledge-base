[Twilio’s Elastic SIP Trunking](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sip-trunking) is effectively a "pipe" that connects an enterprise’s SIP infrastructure to the PSTN. This allows you to make calls from your network to the Public Domain for PSTN access (Termination), and receive calls on Twilio phone numbers on your network (Origination).
