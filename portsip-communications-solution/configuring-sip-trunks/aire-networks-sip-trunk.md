1. Sign in to the PortSIP PBX web portal.
2. Navigate to **Call Manager > Users**, double-click the desired extension, and go to the **Extension** tab.
3. Under the **Send SMS/MMS** option, since AireNetworks SMS always sends the SMS by Sender ID, you must choose **Allow Send SMS with Sender ID**.&#x20;
