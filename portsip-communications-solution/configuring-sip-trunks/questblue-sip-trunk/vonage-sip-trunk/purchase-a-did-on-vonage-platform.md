# Purchase a DID on Vonage Platform

Before placing or receiving calls, you must have at least one active DID (phone number) on your Vonage account.\
If you already have one or more active DIDs, you may skip this section.

#### Step 1: Buy a DID Number

1. Sign in to your [Vonage ](https://ui.idp.vonage.com/ui/auth/login)account.
2. Navigate to **Build & Manage > Numbers > Buy Numbers**.
3. Search for available numbers by **country**.

   * Ensure **Voice** capability is enabled.
   * **SMS** capability is optional—select it only if you plan to use SMS/MMS services.
