# Purchase a DID on Wavix Platform

Before placing or receiving calls through Wavix, you must have at least one active DID (Direct Inward Dialing number) associated with your Wavix account.\
If you already have one or more active DIDs, you may skip this section and proceed directly to trunk configuration.

### Important Notes on DID Activation

> **Note**\
> Some DIDs require **local regulatory documentation** (such as proof of address, business registration, or identity documents) before they can be activated.

* Upload the required documents in the Wavix portal as prompted.
* Inbound calling will remain unavailable until the documents are reviewed and approved.
* Approval is handled by the **Wavix Number Provisioning team** and may take additional time depending on the country.

### Next Steps

Once your DID is successfully purchased and activated, proceed to configure the SIP trunk in PortSIP PBX using one of the following guides:

* [Configuring Wavix IP Authentication Trunk](configuring-wavix-ip-authentication-trunk.md)
* [Configuring Wavix Digest Trunk](configuring-wavix-digest-trunk.md)

After trunk configuration, you can continue with inbound and outbound call routing and SMS/MMS setup as needed.
