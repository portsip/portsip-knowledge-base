# Purchase a DID on SIPTRUNK  Platform

Before you can place or receive calls, you must have at least **one active DID** (or multiple DID numbers) on your [**SIPTRUNK** ](https://www.siptrunk.com)account.

> **Note**\
> If you already have active DID numbers on your SIPTRUNK account, you can skip this section and proceed directly to trunk configuration.

### Create Your SIPTRUNK Account

1. Visit the [SIPTRUNK ](https://www.sipturnk.com)website and sign up for an account.
2. After logging in, ensure that voice services (SIP trunking) are enabled for your account.
