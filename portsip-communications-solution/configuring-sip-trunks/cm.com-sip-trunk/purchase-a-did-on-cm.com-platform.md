# Purchase a DID on CM.com Platform

Before you can place or receive calls, you must have at least **one active DID** (or multiple DID numbers) on your **CM.com** account.

> **Note**\
> If you already have active DID numbers on your CM.com account, you can skip this section and proceed directly to trunk configuration.

***

### Create Your CM.com Account

1. Visit the [CM.com ](./)website and sign up for an account.
2. After logging in, ensure that voice services (SIP trunking) are enabled for your account.

***

### Purchase DID Numbers

1. In the [CM.com](./) portal, follow the guide [How do I order a new DDI number?](https://knowledgecenter.cm.com/knowledge-center/communications-platform/sip-trunking/ddi-numbers/how-do-i-order-a-new-ddi-number)  to purchase the DID numbers.

After the DID numbers are successfully purchased and activated, you can proceed with configuring the [CM.com](./) SIP trunk in PortSIP PBX.

### Next Step

* Configure CM.com IP Authentication Trunk
* Configure CM.com Register Authentication Trunk

This step configures PortSIP PBX to use CM.com for outbound and inbound calling.
