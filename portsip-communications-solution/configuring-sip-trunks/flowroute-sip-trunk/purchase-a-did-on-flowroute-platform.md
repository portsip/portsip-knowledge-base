# Purchase a DID on Flowroute Platform

Before placing or receiving a call, you need to have an active DID or a dozen DID numbers on your Flowroute account. If you already have an active number on your Flowroute account, the below steps are optional.

## Creating Your Flowroute Account

### **1. Create Your Bandwidth Account**

Sign up to the [Flowroute](https://manage.flowroute.com/signup/) website. Once youâ€™re [logged in](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/login/) to your account, start creating your trunk.

### 2. Start by buying numbers

You can do so from the menu **DIDs > Purchase**.

After successfully purchasing the DID numbers, you can now set up the Flowroute trunk.
