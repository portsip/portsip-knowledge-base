# 7 Trunk Management

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking is a digital method for making and receiving calls—and other real-time communications—over an IP network using SIP, an application-layer signaling protocol. In this context, **“trunking”** means aggregating multiple concurrent call paths (channels) into a single logical connection between your PBX and a carrier or service provider.

A SIP trunk typically provides **VoIP connectivity between an on-premises PBX and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)**. For example, an office may run an internal PBX for extension-to-extension calling. By connecting the PBX to a SIP trunk, users can place and receive external calls to/from the public telephone network.

SIP trunking is commonly used to **establish, manage, and terminate call sessions** (call setup, mid-call signaling, and teardown). It is widely adopted because it’s flexible, scalable, and standards-based—helping organizations connect their phone system to external calling services without traditional physical trunks.
