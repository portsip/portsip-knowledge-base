# 7 Trunk Management

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunking is the digital way of making and receiving phone calls and other communications over an internet connection, utilizing SIP, an application layer protocol. "Trunking" in this context refers to the method of consolidating multiple communication channels into a single connection, allowing for the efficient use of resources and connection to a telephone network.

SIP Trunks provision Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connectivity between an on-premise phone system and the public switched telephone network, also known as PSTN. For instance, an office might have an existing PBX for phone service. SIP trunks provide phone service for the entire office so they can reach the outside world.

In short, SIP trunking is used for call setup, management, and teardown. Itâ€™s flexible, reliable, and quite lightweight. This means you can focus on your business instead of the technicalities. SIP is the basis for VoIP communications, and SIP Trunking is used to provide VoIP connectivity through a PBX.
