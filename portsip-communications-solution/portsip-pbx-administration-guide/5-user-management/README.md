# 5 User Management

Tenant administrators can **add, edit, and deactivate users**, assign different **account types**, and configure **tenant-level user settings**. These capabilities are commonly used to:

* Temporarily manage users who are unexpectedly out of the office
* Troubleshoot and adjust user features and permissions
* Configure special settings for executives or other key users

User management helps ensure that user accounts remain accurate, secure, and properly configured as organizational needs change.
