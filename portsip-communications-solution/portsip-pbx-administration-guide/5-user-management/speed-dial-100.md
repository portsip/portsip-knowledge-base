# Speed Dial 100

Speed Dial 100 allows you to assign the numbers you call most. Once programmed you just dial two digits(00-99). You can program this two ways: via the personal web portal or dialing the FAC from IP Phone/Softphone. The web portal is a bit easier to manage and confirm accuracy, but either way can work.
