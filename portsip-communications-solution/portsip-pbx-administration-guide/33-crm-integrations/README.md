# 33 CRM Integrations

### Introduction

CRM integration connects your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with **PortSIP PBX**, enabling seamless synchronization of customer data and voice interactions. With CRM integration enabled, customer profiles, call logs, call recordings, AI transcriptions, and conversation history are automatically captured and made available to agents in real time.

This integration eliminates manual data entry, reduces errors, and empowers agents with immediate access to relevant customer context. As a result, agents can personalize conversations, resolve issues more efficiently, and deliver a consistently higher level of customer experience.

For example, PortSIP PBX CRM integrations—such as [**HubSpot** ](https://www.hubspot.com)and [**Zoho CRM**](https://www.zoho.com)—allow agents to view key customer information, including previous interactions, purchase history, and support tickets, _before_ answering a call. This ensures faster call handling, better-informed conversations, and improved first-call resolution.

### Zoho CRM Integration

[**Zoho CRM**](https://www.zoho.com) is a widely adopted CRM platform that unifies sales, marketing, and customer support operations into a single application.

The **PortSIP PBX – Zoho CRM integration** streamlines agent workflows by enabling:

* **Click-to-call** directly from Zoho CRM using **PortSIP ONE**
* **Automatic caller identification** and matching with existing Zoho contact records
* **Automatic call logging**, including call details and activities

By reducing context switching and manual tasks, this integration allows agents to focus on customer engagement and productivity rather than administrative work.

### HubSpot Integration
