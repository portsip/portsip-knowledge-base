# Installation of PortSIP PBX v22.x

PortSIP PBX can be installed on either a **Linux server** or a **Windows server**. However, the recommended platform depends on the scale and requirements of your deployment:

* **Linux Server (Recommended):**\
  The Linux version is generally recommended for most installations due to its higher performance, scalability, and resource efficiency. Linux servers are better suited for larger deployments and offer greater flexibility for handling high volumes of concurrent calls and users.
* **Windows Server (Recommended for Small Businesses):**\
  The Windows version is suitable for smaller businesses or less complex environments. It provides an easier setup and a familiar interface for administrators who prefer working with Windows-based systems.

## Linux

Starting with version 22.0, PortSIP PBX introduces an Instant Messaging (IM) service, offering modern features such as group chat.&#x20;

The IM service requires a separate installation step if you install the PortSIP PBX on Linux, as in some cases, you may also want to deploy it on a separate server for optimal performance.
