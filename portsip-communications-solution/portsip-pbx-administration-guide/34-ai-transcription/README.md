### Voicemail Transcription

**Voicemail transcription**, available from v22.3, makes it significantly easier to review missed messages without listening to full voicemail recordings.

When enabled, PortSIP PBX converts voicemail audio into text as user required, allowing users to:

* Quickly scan and understand missed messages
* Save time compared to listening to lengthy recordings
* Stay organized and respond more efficiently

This feature is especially valuable for busy professionals who need fast access to voicemail content.

### Call Transcription

**Call transcription and analytics** convert recorded voice calls into searchable, text-based transcripts with sentimental.

Using advanced artificial intelligence, PortSIP PBX enables **transcription**, allowing teams to capture and review conversation details without manual note-taking. This ensures that important information is never lost and improves accuracy in follow-ups, quality assurance, and compliance reviews.

With PortSIP PBX, businesses can enable call transcription without deploying separate transcription services or third-party software. Transcription is seamlessly built into the unified communications platform.

### Granular Control of Transcription

PortSIP PBX provides fine-grained control over transcription to meet operational, privacy, and cost requirements.

### How It Works

Call transcription requires call recording to be enabled, as only recorded calls can be transcribed.

The transcription workflow is as follows:

1. A call is recorded by PortSIP PBX.
2. The recording file link is securely transmitted to the configured AI platform (**AWS or Azure**) for transcription.
3. The AI platform processes the recording and generates the transcription.
4. The transcription result is returned to PortSIP PBX.
5. The temporary audio file is automatically deleted from the AI provider’s server.

By leveraging **AWS and Azure cloud infrastructure**, PortSIP PBX ensures the scalability and performance required to handle transcription workloads efficiently, while maintaining strong security and data-handling practices.
