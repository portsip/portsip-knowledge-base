# Backup and Restore: An Essential Guide

**Backup and restore** refers to the processes and technologies used to create periodic copies of critical data and applications and store them on a separate, secondary system. These backups enable organizations to restore data, applications, and dependent business services if the original systems are lost, corrupted, or unavailable.

Such incidents may result from power failures, cyberattacks, human error, hardware failures, natural disasters, or other unplanned events.

Backup and restore is a **core component of any disaster recovery and business continuity strategy**, ensuring service availability and minimizing downtime.
