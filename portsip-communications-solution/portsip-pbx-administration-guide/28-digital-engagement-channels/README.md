# 28 Digital Engagement Channels

In today’s business environment, digital communication is no longer optional—it is essential. Customers expect to interact with businesses through multiple digital channels to ask questions, share feedback, and engage in real-time conversations. Organizations that fail to meet these expectations risk missed opportunities and diminished customer satisfaction.

PortSIP Digital Engagement enables seamless, omnichannel communication between your business and your customers. By unifying multiple digital channels into a single platform, PortSIP ensures that no customer interaction is overlooked—whether it is handled through automated self-service or live agent engagement.

Each supported channel is designed to deliver:

* **24/7 self-service automation** for common inquiries
* **Efficient escalation to live agents** when human assistance is required
* A **consistent, high-quality customer experience** across all touchpoints

### Supported Channels

PortSIP currently supports the following digital engagement channels, with additional channels planned for future releases:

#### SMS

SMS (Short Message Service) enables businesses to send and receive text messages directly from their business phone numbers to customers’ mobile phones. Unlike internal team messaging or instant messaging platforms—which operate within apps, threads, or channels—SMS establishes a **direct, personal communication channel** using standard phone numbers.

PortSIP PBX integrates with leading [SMS service providers](../../configuring-sip-trunks/), allowing organizations to:

* Send and receive business text messages from their PBX numbers
* Launch outbound SMS campaigns to increase customer engagement
* Enable **two-way SMS conversations** for customer inquiries, confirmations, and notifications

This integration allows businesses to extend traditional voice services into a modern, text-based communication experience while maintaining centralized control within the PBX.

#### WhatsApp

PortSIP’s WhatsApp integration enables businesses to engage customers through one of the world’s most widely used messaging platforms. It supports both **automated and agent-assisted interactions**, allowing organizations to scale customer engagement efficiently.

With WhatsApp integration, you can:

* Automatically respond to frequently asked questions
* Provide instant answers to common customer inquiries
* Orchestrate complex customer journeys using workflow automation

When a conversation requires human assistance, customers can be **seamlessly routed to the appropriate live agent** through the Digital Engagement interface, ensuring a smooth transition from automation to personalized support.
