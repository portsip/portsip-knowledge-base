# 8 Call Route Management

Outbound and inbound rules define how PortSIP PBX routes calls based on specific criteria. With these rules, you can control which trunk is used for a call—for example, to implement **Least Cost Routing (LCR)**, where the PBX selects the lowest-cost route that meets your requirements.

You can also assign **DIDs (Direct Inward Dialing numbers)** so external callers can reach a specific extension (or other destination) directly, without going through a receptionist or IVR.
