# 8 Call Route Management

Outbound and inbound rules determine how PortSIP PBX routes call on the base of certain criteria. You can configure rules to control through which trunk a call will be placed, for example, to route the calls through your trunk on the basis of least cost routing.

You can also set DID (Direct Inward Dialing) numbers to allow you to bypass the receptionist or IVR and place calls directly to a userâ€™s extension.
