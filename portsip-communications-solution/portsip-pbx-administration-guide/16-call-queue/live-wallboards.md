# Live Wallboards

### Live Wallboards Overview

PortSIP Contact Center Live Wallboards provide real-time visibility into contact center performance through dynamic, widget-based dashboards. These wallboards allow supervisors and operations teams to monitor key metrics at a glance and tailor the display to their specific operational needs.

Live wallboards can also be displayed on **large screens** in shared environments, making them ideal for team rooms, operations centers, and supervisor dashboards—ensuring everyone stays aligned on current queue and agent performance.

### Permissions

Access to Live Wallboards is controlled by user roles and permissions:

* Users assigned the **Tenant Administrator** or **Queue Manager** role can access Live Wallboards by default.
* If you create a **custom role**, you must explicitly grant the **Data Analytics** permission.
  * Any user assigned to this custom role will then be able to access Live Wallboards.

This role-based access control ensures secure and appropriate visibility across your contact center operations.
