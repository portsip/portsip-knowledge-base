## PortSIP PBX Free Edition

You can install the PortSIP PBX Free Edition, which supports up to 3 simultaneous calls and allows for 10 extension registrations. If you require additional capacity for more simultaneous calls or extensions, please visit the [PortSIP PBX Pricing](https://www.portsip.com/portsip-pricing/) page for further details.

## Supported Versions of PortSIP PBX

Currently, PortSIP PBX maintains two active versions:&#x20;

* v16.x
* v22.x

We recommend installing the latest v22.x version for the best performance and features. For existing installations running v16.x, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest v22.x version to ensure compatibility and take advantage of the latest enhancements.

## PortSIP ONE App

With the release of PortSIP PBX v22.0, we also introduced the all-new[ PortSIP ONE](https://www.portsip.com/portsip-one/) application.&#x20;

This app includes a wide range of modern business communication features. However, please note that it is **not** compatible with PortSIP PBX v1.6.x.&#x20;

Additionally, the legacy [PortSIP softphone](https://www.portsip.com/portsip-softphone), which was compatible with v1.6.x does not work with v22.x.
