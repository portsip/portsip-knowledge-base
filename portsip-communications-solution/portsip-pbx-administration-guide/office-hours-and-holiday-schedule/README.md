# 30 Office Hours and Holiday Schedule

**Office Hours** and **Holiday Schedules** are configured by the **Tenant Admin** in the PortSIP PBX Web Portal. Once configured, these schedules can be applied to **inbound rules** to control how calls are routed based on:

* Time of day
* Day of the week
* Selected holidays

Using schedules, you can route inbound calls to different destinations, such as **Virtual Receptionists (Auto Attendants)**, **Call Queues**, or **individual users,** to ensure calls are handled appropriately during business hours, after hours, and on holidays.
